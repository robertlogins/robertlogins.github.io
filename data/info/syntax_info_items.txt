Creating our first item

Each word in a file is a section.
For example:

ID

ID is a section that gives an item it's own ID, so it can load all the data.
ID supports values, so we are going something to it.

ID
"0"

Now we have created an item. It is now ready to use!
Save it in: <game directory>\resources\items
Give the file a name, any name will do.

Now we are going to customize it and add some more sections and values.
Name is a section that tells the game the name of an item.
Name also supports values, so we are going to add this:

Name
"Super Mega Ultra Alpha Sword"

Now the item's name is "Super Mega Ultra Alpha Sword".
Our code will look like this:

ID
"0"
Name
"Super Mega Ultra Alpha Sword"

This is an item with a name, but it is still not a real sword.
Now let's make it a sword!

By default, items do 0.5 damage.
We can increase it by using an attribute.
The game already has an attribute for damage, so now we are going to add damage to the item.
Attributes is a section for attributes that the game has.
This is an attribute example to make an item a sword.

Attributes
"0 1000"

0 is the attribute's ID and 1000 is the attributes value.
You can also put 7.5 instead of 1000.
So now our item deals 1000 (or 7.5) damage!
Code:

ID
"0"
Name
"Super Mega Ultra Alpha Sword"
Attributes
"0 1000"
