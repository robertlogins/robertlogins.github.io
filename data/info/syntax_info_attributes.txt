Creating our first attribute

Attributes have some sections that also exist in items: ID and Name.
But they also have more: Check, Do, Type, and more.
Attributes don't overwrite items, so don't worry about putting the ID 0 for both item and attribute.
We are going to make the base.

ID
"0"
Name
"Maximum Health"

So, what to do next?
Type is a section that makes an attribute editable, non-editable, etc.
Let's add:

Type
"Edit"

Now this attribute is editable.
Check and Do are one of the sections that need to be placed after each other (Do after Check for example).
Let's put them now.

Check
Do

But nothing will work without no code, so we are going to add some code.
In this case I want the player to have more maximum health.
So I'm going to add this:

Set Player Maximum Health To Value

In:

Check
Do
Set Player Maximum Health To Value

If we have nothing to check, we can delete the Check section:

Do
Set Player Maximum Health To Value

You don't need to edit this, you'll see why.
Let's imagine that we have a potion.
As we know, we need to put:

Attributes
"<id> <value>"

The attribute is editable so we can put a value into it!
For example... 100.

Attributes
"<id> 100"

Now we will have 100 maximum health when we will drink it!
Our code looks like this now:

ID
"0"
Name
"Maximum Health"
Do
Set Player Maximum Health To Value

We are pretty much done here... but:
What if we are REALLY making a potion?
We must check if the item has been drinked.
So we will actually need to add the Check section:

Check
Do
Set Player Maximum Health To Value

We still have nothing in it, so we will add:

This Was Drinked

in the Check section.

Our code now:

ID
"0"
Name
"Maximum Health"
Check
This Was Drinked
Do
Set Player Maximum Health To Value
